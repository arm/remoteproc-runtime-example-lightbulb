# Zephyr Application

A minimal STM32MP25x Ambient zephyr firmware with an openamp remoteproc application.
The application reads GPIO pin 'gpioa 1' to determine whether it is connected to ground, and reports over rpmsg tty either 'on' or 'off'

## Features
  - Uses Zephyr RTOS
  - Builds for the `stm23mp257f_dk/stmp257fxx/m33` board by default
  - Dockerized multistage image for reproducible builds
  - Extensive debug logs and comments to assist with configuring this on other boards.
  - Uses OpenAMP and RPMSG to communicate with Linux.

## Dependencies
The build is container-based; the host machine only needs the tools that
bootstrap the containerised build:

- Docker or Podman – to run the build and deploy container

## Usage

```bash
# Pre-fetch the base image
# this will save a lot of time when building as docker wont otherwise cache layers this large
podman pull zephyrprojectrtos/zephyr-build:v0.28.0

# Build container
podman build -t amcomms .
# Copy to remote
podman save amcomms | ssh root@remote 'podman load'
# Launch
ssh root@remote 'podman run -d --runtime io.containerd.remoteproc.v1 --annotation remoteproc.name=m33 amcomms'
```

## Manual testing
From the Linux side, you can check rprocmsg is working by running
```bash
cat /dev/ttyRPMSG0
```
on one terminal, and on the other terminal echo arbitrary messages to the same device
```bash
echo "arbitrary" > /dev/ttyRPMSG0
```
You will now see the on/off responses in the cat terminal when the switch's state changes.
